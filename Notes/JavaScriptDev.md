# JavaScript Programming Essentials

## Module 1 - Introduction to JavaScript Development
Javascript is integral to web application development, it makes websites interactive an responsive. 
Javascript uses variables to store and manage data types, var has fuctional scope, let has block scope, const create an immutable value. 

It uses operators to perform comparisons, calculations, logic, assignment, incremetaion.

Javascript manages flow control with conditional statments, if, else, else if, switch. Looping is done with for, while and do while loops.

Fuctions can be parameterized of non-parameterized. 
Immediatly Invoked Functions (IIFE) are functions that are defined and excecuted immediatly after creation.
Functions can be assigned to varibles giving them a name that they can be called by.
Arrow functions are a consise way of writing functions.
The return statment is used to end the execution of the function and specify the return value.
Function closure allows a function to access and remeber caribles from its outerscope.
Fucntions can be declared and implmented later (this doesn't work with fucntions assigned to a variable).

Fucntions can be excuted when a specific event occurs on an Element by adding an event listener.

## Module 2 - Arrays and Objects in JavaScript
JavaScript arrays store a collections of values, they start at index 0. Arrays can contain numbers, strings, objects or other arrays.
Built in arrays methods are provdided such as push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, concat, slice, indexOf, reverse, sort, and lenght.
Arrays can be interated through using the forEach method.
The map method creates a new array by applying a provided fuctnion to each element. 
The reduce method allows you to aggregate the array by applying a specifed function.
The filter method creates a new arrya containgin the elements that pass a specified condition.
The find method returns the first element that satifies a condition.

JavaScript classes allow you to create and organize code in a more structured way. Objects are isntances of classes or can be created as standalone objects with out a class, they can have methods and properties
You can access class properties and methods using the dot notation and bracket notation.

Built in string methods allow for string manupulation.
The built in math object provides methods and constants for math operations.
The built in date object manages date and time values.

Set Interval and Set Timeout are useful for triggering functions.

## Module 3 - Working DOM in JavaScript
Try-Catch blocks can be used to handle errors.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that allow JavaScript to modify the web document structure content and style. It is acessed using the document object. The DOM object is tree like and hierachical and allows access to elements, classes and attributes. Methods for accessing elements include getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, and querySelector.

The Browser Object Model (BOM) facilitates user interaction, window control, navigation, client infromation access and data storage. The BOM in stuctured as several loosely related objects which are responsble for diffrent things, it is not tree-like in contrast to the DOM.
